/*
You are given an array that contains each number between 1â€¦n exactly once. Your task is to collect the numbers from 1 to n in increasing order.

On each round, you go through the array from left to right and collect as many numbers as possible.
What will be the total number of rounds?

OH, this is just simulation - the order is fixed. But each simulation is O(n), so for example,

5 4 3 2 1 

would take a full 5 passes. You want perhaps some way to jump between indices? I want to make a hashmap from values
to indices
